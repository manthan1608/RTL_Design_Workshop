### Introduction
This Workshop intends to teach basics of digital design using verilog language, various RTL coding styles,synthesis and problems faced by industry and how to solve them in Verilog using SKY130 Technology.\
Some of the open source eda tools used in this Workshop are
1. [iverilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) : It is Simulator which used for RTL Simulations and Gate Level Simulations.
2. [yosys](http://www.clifford.at/yosys/) : It is a open source Synthesis tool used for synthesis of RTL Design.
3. [Skywater](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rules/background.html): It is used as 130nm Standard Cell Libraries.

### Day 1 Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis 



### Day 2 Timing libs , Hierarical vs Flat Synthesis and efficient Flop Coding Styles
